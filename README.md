minetest mod floatland
============================

Simple mod to added rare greenbiomes to floadlands event only snown

Information
-----------

This mod is named `floatland_realm`, it produces a large floadlands, 
but the biome is more nice event simple snown when others mods like ethereal 
are present. It provide a command chat to defined an area called `floatland_spawn` 
it redfined the older mod spawm point area of the same name, (but deprecated)

This mod put rare blocks in high lands so a diamond shovel will be need there.

Technical info
--------------

This is a fork for minenux project, from original work of floadlands_realm 
its just to provide nice biomes when other mods like ethereal only produces snown.

it uses the setting from minetest config files of mapgen v7, specially the `mgv7_floatland_level` 
and try to redefined the floatland layer of biome fully.

The spawn point if the merge of the `floatland_spawn` mod code, with some checks, 
original mods were so crude and just overrides all the biome generation.. this mod 
do not redefine the spawn point, for that you can managed after server start and 
world was generated.

Seems in original mod is set per player, the developer are a LOTT/LOTR 
subgame developer so the function were made per player respawns. So due that 
the spawn point generation is only at command invokation for now.
